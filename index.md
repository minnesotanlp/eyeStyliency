**About the study:** We are interested in evaluating how humans process different textual styles (e.g. informal, polite) in order to improve natural language processing models.
IRB number: STUDY00015556.

**Eligibility:** Adult (18 or older), English speaking, with normal or corrected-to-normal vision.

**Study procedure:** Participants will read a series of 1-2 sentence texts (about 2,000 words overall) while their eye movements are tracked. The data collected during this experiment is gaze data, i.e., the focal coordinates of the pupil on the display screen, as well as pupil diameter and responses to short comprehension questions.
