**About the study:** We are interested in evaluating how humans process and understand different types of written text.
IRB number: STUDY00015556.

**Study procedure:** Participants will read a series of excerpts from news articles while their eye movements are tracked. Participants will rate how easy the articles are to read and how well-written the articles are, as well as complete a few free-response questions. In addition to the ratings and free-response questions, other data collected during this experiment is gaze data, i.e., the focal coordinates of the pupil on the display screen, as well as pupil diameter.

**Eligibility:** Adult (18 or older), English speaking, with normal or corrected-to-normal vision.
