## Understanding Human Style Perception via Eye-tracking

### About the study:
We are interested in evaluating how humans process different textual styles (e.g. informal, polite) in order to improve natural language processing models.
IRB number: STUDY00015556.

**Eligibility:** Adult (18 or older), English speaking, with normal or corrected-to-normal vision.

**Study procedure:** Participation will take no more than one hour, and the study takes place on the University of Minnesota campus in Keller Hall. Participants will read a series of 1-2 sentence texts (about 2,000 words overall) while their eye movements are tracked. The data collected during this experiment is gaze data, i.e., the focal coordinates of the pupil on the display screen, as well as pupil diameter and responses to short comprehension questions.
